# Univessel API
- Univessel is a long-term project to provide a unified package managment and build tool generation for C++ development.
- Establishing a connection and fetching data from this API is one of the main aspects of development thus far.

# Not an API
- Not a full fledged API yet but works to test the univessel system to grab templates and more.
